## ðŸš€ Project Update â€” Module 1 Complete (October 2025)

**Milestone:** Windows Optimization (HP Notebook X7T50UA#ABA)

The Green AI Lab project has officially completed its first technical milestone.  
This phase focused on **reviving a legacy HP notebook** into a functional, efficient, and secure base node for future private cloud and AI experiments.

### ðŸ§  Highlights
- Reduced system startup time by **over 50 %**  
- Verified full disk and system file integrity (`chkdsk`, `sfc /scannow`)  
- Cleaned redundant data and reclaimed **â‰ˆ 60 GB** of storage  
- Extended usable lifespan of existing hardware, reducing e-waste  
- Fully documented in GitHub for educational and open-source replication

### ðŸŒ¿ Why It Matters
This milestone represents the foundation of a broader goal:  
> To build a 100 % self-hosted, modular, and sustainable cloud infrastructure using only refurbished and recycled hardware.
